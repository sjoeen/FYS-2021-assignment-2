This assignment contains three files:
1) load_data.py
2) prediction_model.py
3) data_problems2.csv

load_data:
contains handeling of the dataset, print function from the predict model
and plotting of the dataset.

prediction_model:
contains two distribution classes (gamma and gaussian), and a compare class
to check which class is most likely to contain the datapoint. 

data_problems2:
dataset of two classes.

if you havent installed imports, you need to run these cmd in the terminal:
1) pip install pandas
2) pip install numpy
3) pip install matplotlib.pyplot
4) pip install sklearn.model_selection

All the runable code is in the load_data python script. This script utilizes 
the classes from the prediction model and the dataset from data_problems to test the accuracy
of the ML model and plot the data + miss classifications.
